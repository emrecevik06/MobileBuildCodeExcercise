### Exercise 1.4 - Deploy the Project

So far, you have learned how to quickly get started with developing an MDK project in the SAP Business Application Studio editor. Now, you will deploy the project to Mobile Services to use it in the Mobile client.

1. Right-click `Application.app` and select **MDK: Deploy**.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.1.png)

2. If you don't have an active CF session, you may be prompted to log into Cloud Foundry. If prompted, click **Login** to continue. If not, proceed directly to step 8.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.2.png)

3. Choose the **SSO Passcode** as your authentication method, then click on the highlighted hyperlink. This will open a new browser tab.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.3.png)

4. Click on **Sign in with default identity provider**.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.4.png)

    >Cancel the certificate selection if you are prompted to do so in the browser.

5. Copy the Temporary Authentication Code.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.5.png)

6. Switch back to the SAP Business Application Studio page. Paste the copied code into the field labeled **Enter your SSO Passcode** and then click **Sign in**.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.6.png)

7. You are now signed in to the Cloud Foundry. Set the Cloud Foundry target by choosing the appropriate Organization and space from the dropdown menu and then click on **Apply**. Once the Cloud Foundry target is set, the `Cloud Foundry Sign In` tab will automatically close.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.7.png)

8. Select deploy target as **Mobile Services**.

9. Select Mobile Services landscape as **standard**.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.9.png)

10. Select your application **IncidentManagement.myapp.demo** from the Mobile Services.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.10.png)

11. If you want to enable source for debugging the deployed bundle, then choose **Yes**.

    ![MDK](images/1.3.11.png)

    You should see **Deploy to Mobile Services successfully!** message.

### Exercise 1.5 - Display the QR code for onboarding the Mobile app

You will now run the initial application on the Mobile client installed on your device by scanning the on-boarding QR code. 

Click the `Application.app` to open it in MDK Application Editor and then click the **Application QR Code** icon.

![MDK](images/1.4.1.png)
    
The On-boarding QR code is now displayed. Leave the Onboarding dialog box open as you proceed to the next step.

| 10. Tap on **Now** to accept the deployed metadata definitions. | ![MDK](images/1.5.19.png) | ![MDK](images/1.5.20.png) |
| 11. After accepting the app update, the offline store will initialize. You'll see a list of incidents assigned to you and a user menu section on the main page. The User Menu includes the following items. <br/> **Sync Changes:** This allows you to upload any local changes from the Mobile client to the backend and download any delta changes from the backend to the Mobile client. <br/> **Support:** This provides an easy way for users to contact support via a contact cell. The contact information is defined in the global settings. <br/>The Activity Log option on the Support page allows the user to toggle client logging on or off, set the log level, and, if enabled in the Mobile Services application, upload the current client logs.<br/> **Check for Updates:** This checks if new Metadata has been deployed to the Mobile Services App Update. If new Metadata is found, it will be downloaded and prompt the user to apply the changes.<br/> **About:** This page displays the current user/device ID, Application Name, Metadata version, and Client version information.<br/> **Logout:**	This completely resets the client, erasing any downloaded data and application Metadata, and returns the user to the license agreement screen.  | ![MDK](images/1.5.21.png) | ![MDK](images/1.5.22.png) |
| 12. Tap on any of the incidents to navigate to the detail page, where you'll find more information about the incident. You can also access the customer's address via a maps application. If the incident is marked as `closed`, an option to view the image of the defective device will be available. | ![MDK](images/1.5.23.gif) | ![MDK](images/1.5.24.gif) |
